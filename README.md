# Color Sort Game in Android Studio
* The goal of this game is to rearrange colored buttons to create full columns of red, green, and blue buttons.
* Buttons can only be placed at the bottom of an empty column or on top of an already placed block.
* Players get the option of choosing between an easy mode(containing 5 columns) and a hard mode(containing 4 columns) at the home screen.
* To move a block from one place to another, click on where the block is originally, then click on the place in the grid you want it to be in.
* Upon each victory, a prompt will appear asking for the user to either return to the home screen or to play the game again.
